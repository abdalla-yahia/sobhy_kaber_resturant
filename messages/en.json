He quickly gained immense popularity among Egyptians thanks to his deep commitment to engaging with them by offering meals that combine delicious taste with high quality. He achieved his big dream of proudly presenting authentic Egyptian food locally and globally by focusing on cooking traditional meals and delivering the unique Egyptian flavor at the best prices. He later expanded to own his own livestock farm to ensure the highest quality of products and cooking ingredients used in the restaurant, preserving the unique farm-to-table experience. Sobhy Kaber is deeply committed to ingredient quality, tasty food, and excellent service to provide an exceptional customer experience. This enabled him to expand and open many branches in Egypt and across various regions of the Middle East."
